# This configuration file gives defaults for the scripts in
# the devscripts package, as documented in the individual manpages.
# Variables defined here may be overridden by a per-user ~/.devscripts
# configuration file, which has exactly the same syntax as this file.
# 
# This file is sourced by /bin/bash, and should only contain
# comment lines (beginning with a '#'), and lines of the form
# VARIABLE=value
# The value must be quoted if there are spaces in it.
# Variables corresponding to switches (on/off; yes/no) must take
# one of the values 'yes' or 'no'.
# The variable names are all of the form PROGNAME_VARNAME,
# or DEVSCRIPTS_VARNAME if they are more generally applicable.
# 
# As new variables are introduced into the devscripts program, their
# descriptions and default values will be appended as comments
# to this file.
